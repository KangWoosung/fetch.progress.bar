# Usage
Need to run local API server at port 3000:
```js
console]# node /api/index.js
```

# What is incomplete
Progress bar occurs too many renders not just Progress component itself but also its siblings and wrapper as well.

Fetch retry after an abort is disabled for now. It's a challenging task due to the readonly nature of controller.signal.
To implement the retry, a new controller instance needs to be created and made available to all components. This unexpectedly adds complexity for now.




# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```
